# Unofficial Monero Documentation

## Work in Progress

GetMonero.dev attempts to organize basic technical knowledge on Monero in one place. It is a continuation of [the MoneroDocs repo](https://github.com/monerodocs/md).

While technical explanations are out there, knowledge is scattered through reddit posts, git comments, stack exchange answers, chat logs and the source code. This makes it hard to find complete and up-to-date explanations on advanced topics.

The goal is to educate and onboard power users faster.

Please submit your feedback and corrections directly on [github](https://github.com/MAGICGrants/getmonero.dev/issues).
